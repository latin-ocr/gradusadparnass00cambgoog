It seemed, however, to the present editor, that although the
original construction of the work was faulty, its plan was not
radically bad, and that the book might be so altered as to be

made generally useful in schools, and even worthy of occasione-l
consultation by more advanced scholare-

The Gradus had in its later editions been in some respecta
improved3 but almost all the improvements seem to have been
attempted with reference to the correctness of the quantities
of syllables, which, though certainly an important object in a

work of this nature, is by no means the only one requiring 0

consideration 3 the choice of words and expressions being far
more essentia-l to the purity of poetical composition than the
mere quantities of vowels, a knowledge of which is to be
acquired from most grammar-s and dictiones-ies.

are which have been made with a view οῖ’ mpmving the present
edition. First, an English translation has been affixed to each
word 3 and although the original intention of the editor was to
give to esch only its most simple and literal meaning, yet, on
more mature consideration, it seemed to him, that great addi-
tional valae might be given to the book, and that the attention
of the student might be more frequently and beneficially
drawn to it, by making these translations as complete and es
poetical in their nature as the compess ‘of the work would
allow.

Secondly, the verses quoted in exemplification of each word,
and which in former editions were taken indiscriminately from
writers of every description, have in the present been selected
entirely from poets of the highest order 3 uniting, by so doing,
the advantage of showing the quantities of doubtful syllables
with the still more important consideration of giving good
authority for the use of every word.

 

To this point also tenda the third great alteration, which ·
